# Captain-Japan

Fun Project using the web to scrape Manga, Anime, and Light Novels.

What makes Captain Japan different and BETTER than other scrapers, is that CJ (Captain Japan) will generate EPUBS, PDFS, etc... for you. Also, Captain Japan comes with a beautiful front-end app rather than most command-line scrapers. CJ can also be used as a cmd app if that is what you like.

# TODO
- Add function to find chapter numbers in chapter titles.
- Add WuxiaWorld support.
- Add Manga support.
- Add Anime support.
- Add a way to add new sites without coding.
- Fix website overlodaing. (Currently CaptainJapan will look like a DDos rather than a real person)
- Handle the scraping in one class.
- UTF-8 PDF support.
- Incorporate the new PDF maker into the app.

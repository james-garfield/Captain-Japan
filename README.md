# Captain-Japan

Fun Project using the web to scrape Manga, Anime, and Light Novels.

What makes Captain Japan different and BETTER than other scrapers, is that CJ (Captain Japan) will generate EPUBS, PDFS, etc... for you.
Also Captain Japan comes with a beatiful front end app rather than most command line scrapers. CJ can also be used as a cmd app if that is what you like.
